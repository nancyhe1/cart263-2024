# Voice Jam

This project is to understand p5.speech and to engage with all the possiblities. For this project, with the help of Pippin, We came up with a pronunciation game, where the user will have to try and pronunciate the displayed Mandarin word correctly and according to how many tries, the computer will either help them or make fun of them for pronunciating it wrong.
